# Hi, I'm Bartek

I am a passionate software developer and I love to customize my tools.
That's why I mainly use NeoVim on Arch Linux (btw).
I also like to nerd about keyboards and keyboard layouts
(probably I'll switch from QWERTY to [BEAKL](https://ieants.cc/beakl/) soon).

I enjoy exploring and learning new programming languages [and also creating them!](https://github.com/bartoszluka/seal).

My favorite programming languages are:

- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
- C#

## Projects I'm proud of

- [seal](https://github.com/bartoszluka/seal) - a simple C-like language.
  The projects consists of a parser, interpreter and a compiler to LLVM intermediete representation
- [fsharp-algs](https://github.com/bartoszluka/fsharp-algs) - implementation of a few sorting algorithms in F#.
  The project also has benchmarks against the builitn `sort` function
- [geometry.hs](https://github.com/bartoszluka/geometry.hs) - a library for analytic geometry, written in Haskell.
  Currently a work in progress but in the future it may have a [geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) or [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) like interface
- [advent of code 2021](https://github.com/bartoszluka/advent-of-code-2021-haskell) - advent of code solutions in Haskell
- [advent of code 2022](https://github.com/bartoszluka/aoc2022) - advent of code solutions in Rust
