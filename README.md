# Hi, I'm Bartek

I am a passionate software developer and I love to customize my tools.
That's why I mainly use NeoVim on Arch Linux (btw).
I also like to nerd about keyboards and keyboard layouts
(probably I'll switch from QWERTY to [BEAKL](https://ieants.cc/beakl/) soon).

I enjoy exploring and learning new programming languages [and also creating them!](https://github.com/bartoszluka/seal).

My favorite programming languages are:

- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
- C#
